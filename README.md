# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I feel like implementing the BEM file structure at the end of the project was tedious and out of order.
By putting it at the end of the project, after creating 3 seperate blocks, I feel that it could needlessly confuse people.
By forcing them to now find and seperate their css file.
As far as page design, it's simplistic with simple backgrounds, but this is also still sprint 2 of the course so I wouldn't expect anything more. I would expect in future projects for them to be more complicated and have more design options as well as more freedom to design anything and everything.
